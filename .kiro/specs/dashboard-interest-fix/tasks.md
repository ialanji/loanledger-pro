# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix backend API endpoints (COMPLETED)

- [x] 1.1 Fix `/api/payments/historical` endpoint in server.js (COMPLETED)
  - Fixed endpoint to query `credit_payment` table with proper filtering
  - Added `WHERE p.status = 'paid'` filter for actual paid payments
  - Endpoint now returns 32 paid payments totaling 2,471,748.10 L in interest
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 1.2 Fix `/api/credits` endpoint to include status field (COMPLETED)
  - Added `'active' as status` to SQL query
  - All credits now have active status, enabling schedule loading
  - Dashboard can now load 2 active credits successfully
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Update dashboard frontend to use corrected endpoints

- [x] 2.1 Update fetchDashboardData function in Dashboard.tsx

  - Replace `/api/payments` fetch with `/api/payments/historical`
  - Update variable names to reflect historical payments usage
  - Add error handling for historical payments endpoint
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2.2 Update calculateDashboardStats function to use historical payments


  - Modify function signature to accept historicalPayments parameter
  - Update function calls to pass historical payments data
  - Ensure calculation uses historical payments for paid interest calculation
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Add comprehensive logging and validation

- [x] 3.1 Add detailed logging to calculateDashboardStats function

  - Log total scheduled interest from all schedules
  - Log paid interest from historical payments
  - Log final projected interest calculation
  - Log data source information for debugging
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4_

- [x] 3.2 Add validation for expected calculation results

  - Verify projected interest shows ~186,301 L instead of 2,658,049 L
  - Add console warnings if calculation seems incorrect
  - Validate that historical payments data is being used
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Test and verify the complete fix

- [x] 4.1 Test dashboard with corrected frontend implementation


  - Restart server to ensure backend changes are active
  - Verify dashboard loads 2 active credits
  - Confirm historical payments endpoint returns 32 paid payments
  - Validate final projected interest calculation shows ~186,301 L
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.3_
