# Task 3 Implementation Summary

## Task: Update backend API for credit editing with type modification

### Implementation Date
October 2, 2025

### Changes Made

#### 1. Modified PUT /api/credits/:id Endpoint (server.js)

**Added creditType parameter extraction:**
- Added `creditType` to the destructured request body parameters
- Location: Line ~2147

**Added creditType validation:**
- Validates that creditType is either 'investment' or 'working_capital'
- Returns 400 error with descriptive message for invalid values
- Location: Lines ~2185-2199

**Added business logic for payment existence check:**
- Checks if payments exist for the credit using the existing `has_payments` flag
- Prevents creditType changes when payments exist
- Returns 400 error: "Cannot change credit type when payments exist"
- Allows creditType changes when no payments exist
- Location: Lines ~2193-2198

**Added creditType to update fields:**
- creditType can be updated only when no payments exist
- Uses parameterized query with proper SQL placeholder ($n)
- Location: Lines ~2234-2239

**Response includes credit_type:**
- The final SELECT query uses `SELECT c.*` which includes all columns including credit_type
- The response automatically includes the updated credit_type value
- Location: Lines ~2461-2467

#### 2. Enhanced Integration Tests (tests/integration/test_credit_type.js)

**Added Test 6: Update credit type when no payments exist**
- Creates a credit with 'investment' type
- Updates it to 'working_capital' type
- Verifies the update succeeds with status 200
- Confirms the credit_type field is updated in the response

**Added Test 7: Attempt to update credit type when payments exist**
- Creates a credit with 'investment' type
- Creates a payment for that credit
- Attempts to update credit type to 'working_capital'
- Verifies the update fails with status 400
- Confirms error message: "Cannot change credit type when payments exist"

**Added Test 8: Update credit type with invalid value**
- Creates a credit with 'investment' type
- Attempts to update with invalid credit type value
- Verifies the update fails with status 400
- Confirms appropriate error message is returned

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 3.5**: WHEN saving changes THEN the updated credit type SHALL be persisted to the database
- Implementation: creditType is added to updateFields and updateValues arrays, then persisted via UPDATE query

✅ **Requirement 3.6**: IF attempting to change type with existing payments THEN the system SHALL prevent the change and display a warning
- Implementation: Business logic checks `hasPayments` flag and prevents creditType changes, returning 400 error

✅ **Requirement 6.4**: WHEN updating a credit via PUT /api/credits/:id THEN the API SHALL accept creditType in the request body
- Implementation: creditType is extracted from req.body and processed

### Technical Details

**Validation Logic:**
```javascript
if (creditType !== undefined) {
  const validCreditTypes = ['investment', 'working_capital'];
  if (!validCreditTypes.includes(creditType)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'Invalid credit type. Must be \'investment\' or \'working_capital\'' 
    });
  }
  
  if (hasPayments && currentCredit.credit_type && creditType !== currentCredit.credit_type) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'Cannot change credit type when payments exist' 
    });
  }
}
```

**Update Logic:**
```javascript
if (creditType !== undefined && !hasPayments) {
  updateFields.push(`credit_type = $${paramIndex}`);
  updateValues.push(creditType);
  paramIndex++;
}
```

### Testing

**Manual Testing:**
To test the implementation manually:

1. Start the server: `npm run server`
2. Run the integration tests: `node tests/integration/test_credit_type.js`

**Expected Test Results:**
- Test 6 should PASS: Credit type updates successfully when no payments exist
- Test 7 should PASS: Credit type update is prevented when payments exist
- Test 8 should PASS: Invalid credit type values are rejected

### Error Handling

**Error Scenarios:**
1. Invalid credit type value → 400 Bad Request
2. Attempting to change credit type with existing payments → 400 Bad Request
3. Credit not found → 404 Not Found (existing behavior)
4. Credit not active → 400 Bad Request (existing behavior)

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing credits without credit_type will have the default value 'investment' from the database
- The creditType parameter is optional in PUT requests
- If creditType is not provided, the existing value is preserved
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

### Notes

- The implementation follows the same pattern as other editable fields (paymentDay, termMonths, defermentMonths)
- The payment existence check reuses the existing `has_payments` flag from the initial credit query
- The validation happens before any database updates, ensuring data integrity
- The response automatically includes credit_type through the SELECT c.* query

### Next Steps

The next task in the implementation plan is:
- Task 4: Update backend API GET endpoints to return credit type
