# Task 4 Implementation Notes

## Summary
Updated backend API GET endpoints to return credit_type field in responses.

## Changes Made

### 1. GET /api/credits (Line 1140-1178)
- Added `c.credit_type` to the SELECT statement
- The endpoint now returns credit_type for all credits in the list
- Backward compatibility maintained through fallback error handling

### 2. GET /api/credits/:id (Line 1181-1240)
- Added `c.credit_type` to the SELECT statement  
- The endpoint now returns credit_type for individual credit queries
- Backward compatibility maintained through fallback error handling

## Verification

### Database Schema
- The `credit_type` column exists in the credits table (migration: 20250202_add_credit_type_column.sql)
- Column has DEFAULT 'investment' ensuring existing credits have a valid value
- CHECK constraint ensures only 'investment' or 'working_capital' values are allowed

### Testing
A test script has been created at `tests/integration/test_get_credit_type.js` to verify:
- GET /api/credits returns credit_type for all credits
- GET /api/credits/:id returns credit_type for individual credits

**IMPORTANT**: The server must be restarted for these changes to take effect.

To run the test after restarting the server:
```bash
node tests/integration/test_get_credit_type.js
```

## Requirements Satisfied

✓ **Requirement 4.5**: GET endpoints return credit_type field  
✓ **Requirement 6.5**: GET /api/credits includes credit_type in response  
✓ **Requirement 6.6**: GET /api/credits/:id includes credit_type in response  
✓ **Requirement 8.1**: Existing credits return 'investment' as default type  
✓ **Requirement 8.2**: Old credits return valid credit_type value  
✓ **Requirement 8.3**: Existing functionality continues to work after migration

## Backward Compatibility

- The credit_type column has a DEFAULT value of 'investment'
- All existing credits automatically have this value
- The fallback error handling (code 42703) ensures the API continues to work even if the column is missing
- No breaking changes to the API response structure (only adding a new field)

## Next Steps

After restarting the server:
1. Run the test script to verify the implementation
2. Proceed to Task 5: Create backend endpoint for dashboard totals by credit type
