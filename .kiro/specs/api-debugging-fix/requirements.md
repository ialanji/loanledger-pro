# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical 500 Internal Server Error issues affecting the `/aliases` and `/expenses` API endpoints at `http://localhost:8091/aliases` and `http://localhost:8091/expenses`. The system needs comprehensive debugging using Playwright for automated testing and systematic error resolution to restore full functionality to these core financial management endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Playwright to systematically test and debug API endpoints, so that I can identify the root cause of 500 Internal Server Error issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run Playwright tests against the aliases endpoint THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stack traces and database query failures
2. WHEN I run Playwright tests against the expenses endpoint THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including response headers and timing data
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log comprehensive debugging information to identify the specific failure point
4. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify both successful and error response scenarios

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the aliases API endpoint to handle type filtering correctly, so that department and supplier aliases can be retrieved without server errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request `/api/aliases?type=department` THEN the system SHALL return only department aliases without throwing 500 errors
2. WHEN I request `/api/aliases?type=supplier` THEN the system SHALL return only supplier aliases without throwing 500 errors
3. WHEN I request `/api/aliases` without type parameter THEN the system SHALL return all aliases properly formatted
4. WHEN the aliases table doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically and return an empty array
5. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages instead of generic 500 errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want the expenses API endpoint to function reliably, so that I can manage expense data without encountering server errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the expenses endpoint THEN the system SHALL return expense data in the correct format without 500 errors
2. WHEN the expenses table doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically with the proper schema
3. WHEN I perform CRUD operations on expenses THEN the system SHALL handle all operations without server errors
4. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive Playwright test coverage for API endpoints, so that I can prevent regression issues and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the test suite THEN the system SHALL test all CRUD operations for both aliases and expenses endpoints
2. WHEN I run API tests THEN the system SHALL verify response status codes, headers, and data structure
3. WHEN I run integration tests THEN the system SHALL test database connectivity and query execution
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure reports with actionable debugging information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the API layer, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including request context and database state
2. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages rather than generic server errors
3. WHEN the system encounters connection issues THEN it SHALL implement proper retry logic and graceful degradation
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging without exposing sensitive data
