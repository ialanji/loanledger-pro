# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating daisyUI component library into the existing financial management system that currently uses Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components. The integration should provide additional UI components while maintaining compatibility with the existing design system and ensuring no conflicts with current styling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate daisyUI into the existing Tailwind CSS setup, so that I can access additional pre-built UI components for faster development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN daisyUI is installed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing Tailwind CSS functionality
2. WHEN daisyUI is configured THEN the system SHALL not break existing shadcn/ui components
3. WHEN the development server is restarted THEN daisyUI components SHALL be available for use
4. WHEN daisyUI themes are configured THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark mode themes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want daisyUI to work seamlessly with the existing PostCSS setup, so that the build process remains efficient and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN daisyUI styles SHALL be properly compiled with Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN using Vite dev server THEN daisyUI components SHALL have proper styling and hot reload support
3. WHEN building for production THEN daisyUI styles SHALL be included in the final CSS bundle
4. IF there are PostCSS configuration conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure daisyUI themes appropriately, so that the UI components match the existing design system and support the application's theming requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN daisyUI themes are configured THEN they SHALL support the existing light/dark mode toggle
2. WHEN base styles are configured THEN they SHALL not conflict with existing shadcn/ui base styles
3. WHEN custom themes are needed THEN the configuration SHALL allow for theme customization
4. IF styling conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize existing component styles over daisyUI defaults

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test daisyUI components in the application, so that I can verify the integration works correctly and components render properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN daisyUI button components are used THEN they SHALL render with proper styling
2. WHEN daisyUI alert components are used THEN they SHALL display correctly
3. WHEN daisyUI components are combined with existing components THEN there SHALL be no visual conflicts
4. WHEN responsive design is tested THEN daisyUI components SHALL work properly across different screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper documentation and examples of daisyUI usage, so that the team can effectively use the new components in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is complete THEN there SHALL be clear documentation on how to use daisyUI components
2. WHEN conflicts arise THEN there SHALL be guidelines on resolving shadcn/ui and daisyUI conflicts
3. WHEN new components are needed THEN there SHALL be examples of proper daisyUI component usage
4. IF custom styling is required THEN there SHALL be documentation on how to extend daisyUI components
