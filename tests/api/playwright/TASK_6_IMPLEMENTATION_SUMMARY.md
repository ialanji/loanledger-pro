## Technical Implementation

### Server Integration
```javascript
// Comprehensive logging middleware
app.use(requestLoggingMiddleware);
app.use(performanceMonitoringMiddleware);
app.use(errorLoggingMiddleware);

// Database logging and monitoring
createDatabaseQueryLogger(pool);
createConnectionPoolMonitor(pool);

// System monitoring with alerting
const systemMonitor = initializeSystemMonitoring(pool, {
  checkInterval: 60000,
  alertThresholds: {
    responseTime: 5000,
    memoryUsage: 0.85,
    errorRate: 0.1,
    connectionPoolUsage: 0.8
  }
});

// Debug routes for monitoring
setupDebugRoutes(app, pool);
```

### Logging Examples
The system automatically logs all requests with structured data:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T20:57:05.600Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "category": "REQUEST",
  "message": "Incoming request",
  "requestId": "ecc34499",
  "data": {
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "/api/aliases",
    "headers": {...},
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
  }
}
```

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T20:57:05.717Z",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "memory": {
    "heapUsed": 45.2,
    "heapTotal": 67.8,
    "external": 12.3,
    "rss": 89.1
  },
  "database": {
    "healthy": true,
    "responseTime": 15
  },
  "connectionPool": {
    "totalConnections": 3,
    "idleConnections": 2,
    "waitingRequests": 0,
    "maxConnections": 20
  }
}
```
