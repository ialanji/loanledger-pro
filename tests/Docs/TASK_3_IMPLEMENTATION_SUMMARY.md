# Task 3 Implementation Summary: Backend API Enhancements for Portfolio Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented all subtasks for Task 3: "Implement backend API enhancements for portfolio report"

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ Subtask 3.1: Update database query to include credit details
- Modified SQL query to SELECT all required credit fields (id, contract_number, principal, start_date, bank_id)
- Added JOIN with banks table for bank names
- Added LEFT JOIN with payments table for payment aggregation
- Grouped results by bank_id and credit_id
- Results are ordered by bank name and contract number

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
const creditsQuery = `
  SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.contract_number,
    c.principal,
    c.start_date,
    c.bank_id,
    b.name as bank_name,
    COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) as paid_amount
  FROM credits c
  LEFT JOIN banks b ON c.bank_id = b.id
  LEFT JOIN payments p ON c.id = p.credit_id
  WHERE ${whereClause}
  GROUP BY c.id, c.contract_number, c.principal, c.start_date, c.bank_id, b.name
  ORDER BY b.name, c.contract_number
`;
```

### ✅ Subtask 3.2: Implement current rate lookup for each credit
- Created efficient subquery to fetch rates from `credit_rates` table
- Filters by `credit_id` and `effective_date <= dateTo` (or current date)
- Orders by `effective_date DESC` and takes first result using DISTINCT ON
- Handles case when no rate is found (defaults to 0%)

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
const ratesQuery = `
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (credit_id)
    credit_id,
    rate
  FROM credit_rates
  WHERE credit_id = ANY($1)
    AND effective_date <= $2
  ORDER BY credit_id, effective_date DESC
`;
```

### ✅ Subtask 3.3: Calculate remaining balance for each credit
- Computes `principal - COALESCE(SUM(payments.amount), 0)` for each credit
- Stores in `remaining_balance` field in the response
- Handles credits with no payments correctly

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
const paidAmount = parseFloat(credit.paid_amount) || 0;
const principal = parseFloat(credit.principal) || 0;
const remainingBalance = principal - paidAmount;
```

### ✅ Subtask 3.4: Implement weighted average rate calculation
- For each credit, calculates `weighted_contribution = remaining_balance * current_rate`
- Sums all weighted contributions per bank: `weightedRateSum`
- Sums all remaining balances per bank: `totalWeight`
- Calculates average: `avgRate = weightedRateSum / totalWeight * 100`
- Handles division by zero (returns 0% if totalWeight is 0)

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// During credit processing
bankMap[bankName].weightedRateSum += remainingBalance * rate;
bankMap[bankName].totalWeight += remainingBalance;

// Final calculation
const avgRate = bank.totalWeight > 0 
  ? (bank.weightedRateSum / bank.totalWeight) * 100 
  : 0;
```

### ✅ Subtask 3.5: Structure response with credit details array
- Groups credits by bank into `credits` array
- Includes all required fields: id, contractNumber, principal, startDate, paidAmount, remainingBalance, rate
- Calculates bank-level aggregates: creditCount, totalPrincipal, totalPaid, remainingBalance

**Response Structure:**
```javascript
{
  bank: string,
  creditCount: number,
  totalPrincipal: number,
  avgRate: number,
  totalPaid: number,
  remainingBalance: number,
  credits: [
    {
      id: string,
      contractNumber: string,
      principal: number,
      startDate: string,
      paidAmount: number,
      remainingBalance: number,
      rate: number
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Subtask 3.6: Calculate overall totals across all banks
- Sums totalPrincipal across all banks
- Sums totalCredits (count) across all banks
- Sums totalPaid across all banks

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
const totalPrincipal = portfolioData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.totalPrincipal, 0);
const totalCredits = portfolioData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.creditCount, 0);
const totalPaid = portfolioData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.totalPaid, 0);
```

### ✅ Subtask 3.7: Add error handling for database queries
- Wrapped all queries in try-catch blocks
- Returns 500 status with error message on failure
- Logs detailed errors to console for debugging
- Includes error message in response for better debugging

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error fetching portfolio report:', error);
  res.status(500).json({ 
    error: 'Internal server error',
    message: error.message 
  });
}
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Filter Support**: The endpoint now properly supports `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, and `bankId` query parameters
2. **Weighted Average Rate**: Correctly calculates weighted average interest rates based on remaining balances
3. **Credit Details**: Returns detailed information about each credit within each bank
4. **Date-based Rate Lookup**: Retrieves the appropriate interest rate based on the specified date or current date
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ Requirement 3.3: Credit details display in portfolio report
- ✅ Requirement 4.3, 4.4: Remaining balance calculation on specified date
- ✅ Requirement 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7: Weighted average rate calculation
- ✅ Requirement 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8: Backend API enhancements

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various date ranges to ensure rate lookup works correctly
2. Test with credits that have no payments (remaining balance = principal)
3. Test with fully paid credits (remaining balance = 0)
4. Test weighted average calculation with known test data
5. Test error handling by simulating database failures
6. Verify response structure matches TypeScript interfaces

## Files Modified

- `server.js`: Updated `/api/reports/portfolio` endpoint (lines ~3002-3180)

## Files Verified

- `src/services/reportsService.ts`: TypeScript interfaces already match the new response structure

## Backup

A backup of the original server.js was created at `server.js.backup` before modifications.
