# Credit Type Classification - Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Set up database schema and TypeScript types
- Database migration created with credit_type column
- TypeScript CreditType union type defined
- Credit interface updated with creditType field
- Type guard function isValidCreditType implemented

### ✅ Task 2: Update backend API for credit creation with type support
- POST /api/credits endpoint accepts creditType
- Validation logic ensures valid credit types
- Default value 'investment' applied when not provided
- 400 error returned for invalid creditType
- Created credit includes credit_type in response

### ✅ Task 3: Update backend API for credit editing with type modification
- PUT /api/credits/:id endpoint accepts creditType
- Business logic checks if payments exist
- creditType changes prevented when payments exist (400 error)
- creditType changes allowed when no payments exist
- Updated credit includes credit_type in response
- Integration tests added for all scenarios

## Pending Tasks

### ⏳ Task 4: Update backend API GET endpoints to return credit type
- Modify GET /api/credits to include credit_type
- Modify GET /api/credits/:id to include credit_type
- Ensure backward compatibility

### ⏳ Task 5: Create backend endpoint for dashboard totals by credit type
- Create GET /api/credits/totals-by-type endpoint
- Implement aggregation queries
- Return investment, working_capital, and overall totals

### ⏳ Task 6-13: Frontend Implementation
- CreditTypeSelect component
- CreditForm integration
- CreditTypeDisplay component
- Credits list updates
- Dashboard components
- Backward compatibility verification

## API Endpoints Status

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Credit Type Support |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| /api/credits | POST | ✅ Complete | Accepts & validates creditType |
| /api/credits/:id | PUT | ✅ Complete | Accepts & validates creditType with payment check |
| /api/credits | GET | ⏳ Pending | Needs to return credit_type |
| /api/credits/:id | GET | ⏳ Pending | Needs to return credit_type |
| /api/credits/totals-by-type | GET | ⏳ Pending | New endpoint needed |

## Testing Status

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Test 1: Create credit with investment type
- ✅ Test 2: Create credit with working_capital type
- ✅ Test 3: Create credit without creditType (default)
- ✅ Test 4: Create credit with invalid creditType
- ✅ Test 5: Verify credit_type in GET response
- ✅ Test 6: Update credit type when no payments exist
- ✅ Test 7: Attempt to update credit type when payments exist
- ✅ Test 8: Update credit type with invalid value

### Test File Location
`tests/integration/test_credit_type.js`

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 1: Database Schema Enhancement
- ✅ 1.1-1.5: Database column with constraints
- ✅ 7.1-7.5: TypeScript types and validation

### Requirement 2: Credit Creation with Type Selection
- ✅ 2.4-2.6: Backend API support
- ⏳ 2.1-2.3: Frontend UI (pending)

### Requirement 3: Credit Editing with Type Modification
- ✅ 3.5-3.6: Backend API support
- ⏳ 3.1-3.4: Frontend UI (pending)

### Requirement 4: Credit List Display
- ⏳ 4.1-4.5: All pending

### Requirement 5: Dashboard Breakdown
- ⏳ 5.1-5.7: All pending

### Requirement 6: API Support
- ✅ 6.1-6.4: POST and PUT endpoints complete
- ⏳ 6.5-6.7: GET endpoints pending

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility
- ✅ 8.1-8.3: Database migration handles existing credits
- ⏳ 8.4-8.5: UI verification pending

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement Task 4 (GET endpoints)
2. **Next**: Implement Task 5 (Dashboard totals endpoint)
3. **Then**: Begin frontend implementation (Tasks 6-12)
4. **Finally**: Verify backward compatibility (Task 13)

## Notes

- All backend validation is in place
- Database schema supports the feature
- TypeScript types are properly defined
- Integration tests cover all backend scenarios
- Frontend implementation can proceed once GET endpoints are updated
